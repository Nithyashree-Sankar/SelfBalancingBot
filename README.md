# SelfBalancingBot
Self- balancing is a process by which a system achieves stability
by internal forces. The basic idea of this project is to overcome
the challenge of balancing initially unstable system, by providing
control mechanism to the robot so that it can balance on its
own. The robot uses sensor values provided by accelerometer
and gyroscope to find exact position of itself in three dimensional geometry and send the values to microcontroller.The microcontroller on the other hand uses programs in it to give proper instruction about rotation of wheels to the motor driver module which in turn helps to balance the robot
